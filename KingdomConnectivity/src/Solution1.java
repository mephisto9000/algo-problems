 * InterviewStreet - Kingdom Connectivity
 * Passed 10/10
 * 
 * It has been a prosperous year for King Charles and he is rapidly expanding his kingdom.A beautiful new kingdom 
 * has been recently constructed and in this kingdom there are many cities connected by a number of one-way roads.
 * Two cities may be directly connected by more than one roads, this is to ensure high connectivity.
 * 
 * In this new kingdom King Charles has made one of the cities at his financial capital and one as warfare capital 
 * and he wants high connectivity between these two capitals.The connectivity of a pair of cities say city A and 
 * city B is defined as the number of different paths from city A to city B. A path may use a road more than once 
 * if possible. Two paths are considered different if they do not use exactly the same sequence of roads.
 * 
 * There are N cities numbered 1 to N in the new kingdom and M one-way roads  . City 1 is the monetary capital and 
 * city N is the warfare capital.
 * 
 * You being one of the best programmers in new kingdom need to answer the connectivity of financial capital and 
 * warfare capital ,i.e number of different paths from city 1 to city N.
 * 
 * Input Description:
 * 
 * First line contains two integers N and M.
 * 
 * Then follow M lines ,each having two integers say x and y, 1<=x,y<=N , indicating there is a road from city x to city y.
 * 
 * Output Description:
 * 
 * Print the number of different paths from city 1 to city N modulo 1,000,000,000(10^9).If there are infinitely many 
 * different paths print "INFINITE PATHS"(quotes are for clarity).
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 * 5 5
 * 1 2
 * 2 4
 * 2 3
 * 3 4
 * 4 5
 * 
 * Sample Output :
 * 2
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 * 5 5
 * 1 2
 * 4 2
 * 2 3
 * 3 4
 * 4 5
 * 
 * Sample Output :
 * INFINITE PATHS
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 2<=N<=10,000(10^4)
 * 
 * 1<=M<=1,00,000(10^5) 
 * 
 * Two cities may be connected by more than two roads and in that case those roads are to be considered different for 
 * counting distinct paths
